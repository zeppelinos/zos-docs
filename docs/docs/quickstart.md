# Quickstart

## Install

`zos` is the command line interface to ZeppelinOS. To install it, run:

    npm install --global zos

## Set up the application

`zos` integrates with Truffle. To set it up, run:

    npm install --global truffle
    mkdir myproject && cd myproject
    truffle init

To initialize the `zos` application, run:

    zos init myproject 0.0.1

## Write smart contracts

Write the contracts as you would normally do, but replacing constructors with
`initialize` functions using the modifier from `zos-lib`. To install the lib:

    npm install zos-lib

A simple contract would look like this:

    import "zos-lib/contracts/migrations/Migratable.sol";

    contract MyContract is Migratable {
      uint256 public x;

      function initialize(uint256 _x) isInitializer("MyContract", "0") public {
        x = _x;
      }
    }

Compile it with:

    npx truffle compile

## Use ZeppelinOS to make your contracts safer and easier to develop

Register all the contract implementations of the first version of your
project running:

    zos add <contract_name_1>
    zos add <contract_name_2>
    ...
    zos add <contract_name_n>

In our example, run:

    zos add MyContract

Push your application to the network running:

    zos push --network <network>

Create upgradeability proxies for each of your contracts with:

    zos create <contract_name_1> --network <network>
    zos create <contract_name_2> --network <network>
    ...
    zos create <contract_name_n> --network <network>

This command takes an optional `--init` flag to call an initialization/migration
function after you create the proxy.

In our simple example we want to call the initialize function, with some value
(e.g: 42) thus:

    zos create MyContract --init initialize --args 42 --network development

Re-use already deployed contracts from a ZeppelinOS standard library. To do so,
run the `link` command, with the name of the npm package of the stdlib you
want to use. For example:

    zos link openzeppelin-zos

Push the application to connect it with the chosen standard library on the
target network:

    zos push --network <network>

Update the smart contracts' code to fix a bug, add a new feature, etc. After
making the changes, compile and push them:

    npx truffle compile
    zos push --network <network>

And upgrade the already deployed proxies:

    zos upgrade <contract_name_1> --network <network>
    zos upgrade <contract_name_2> --network <network>
    ...
    zos upgrade <contract_name_n> --network <network>

In our simple example:

    zos upgrade MyContract --network development

The address is the same as before, but the code has been changed to the latest
version.

Voil√†! With this, your contracts can be linked to standard libraries and can be
easily upgraded.
